Local Task Management App

  Overview
       This Task Management App helps you prioritize and manage your tasks efficiently using the Eisenhower Matrix framework. The app works locally on your device, ensuring data privacy and fast performance. Tasks are categorized into four quadrants:

1. Do: Urgent & Important tasks that need immediate attention.
2. Schedule: Important but Not Urgent tasks to plan for the future.
3. Delegate: Urgent but Not Important tasks that can be assigned to others.
4. Delete: Tasks that are neither urgent nor important and can be eliminated.
